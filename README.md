# VBAExcel
Visual Basic for Applications (#VBA) codes with personal functions for Excel, utilities and some games. I am uploading my old files, some of those were made in old Version of Excel, like Excel 97, I am just updating the code and the files format to Excel 2010 before upload it, more files are coming up for air.
